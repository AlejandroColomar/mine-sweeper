	If you make a version or fork it, please tell me.
	I would like to see it. Thank you.

COMPILE:
	linux: 
		$ make
	windows (MSYS):
		$ make OS=win


THE PROGRAM DOES:
	This program creates a random matrix that represents an independent set,
	and then uses an algorithm developed by me to solve it.
	
	The 1s in the matrix mean that the two rows are compatible (rows and
	columns are the same)

	The 0s mean incompatibility between rows.
 
	The algorithm returns the largest possible list of rows that are all
	compatible, and its lenght.

	The program also returns the time (s) needed to solve the problem.

	You can select verbose mode to see the steps of the process,
	although that steps are not yet explained, and you will see a lot of
	numbers like if it were The Matrix.


P = NP:
	I have used it writing down the times used to solve different matrices,
	and it seems to me that it is working in P time, but that would imply
	too many things, so I'm not really sure...  Maybe it uses NP time...  Or
	maybe it begins thermonuclear war... who knows?
	
	I am running benchmarks to see if it really works.

 - PLEASE, IF YOU DOWNLOAD AND USE IT, LET ME KNOW WHAT YOUR RESULTS ARE,
	WHETHER THEY'RE GOOD OR BAD!!

 - I know the code is not very readable. When I have time, I will change that,
	as well as also explain the algorithm.

Thank you for reading until here. :-)


MENU:
	When you run the program, it starts in a menu that has these branches:

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

	/*
	 * It uses a lot of RAM
